Project 2 at Metis Data science, Codenamed *Luther*, uses web scraping, linear
regression, and supervised machine learning techniques to look at an interesting
question related to movie and film.

# The Roger-Ebertron

The *Roger-Ebertron (v0.3)* is a machine learning algorithm designed to learn how
renowned late movie critic Roger Ebert would review movies today.

With the abundance of data on movies, scripts, reviews, and forums for everyone -
critics and general audience to express their opinion on movies - can I try to
model Mr. Ebert's movie ratings against everyone else's?

So I would like to explore the question: **Can we model the movie preferences of
the late Mr. Roger Ebert and estimate how he would continue to rate movies
today?**

Furthermore, can we create a machine learning algorithm that can not only rate
movies similarly, but maybe even analyze movie elements and write reviews as he
had?
